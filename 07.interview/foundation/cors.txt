CORS
==========

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page 
    to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served

                                            OR 

“CORS” stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It allows you to make requests from one website 
  to another website in the browser, which is normally prohibited by another browser policy called the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).

If we can control the backend we can set up cors in such a way that we can setup the who can 
    make request to our backend to fetch resources

CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.

Install cors: 
npm i cors

Now we can use it: 
app.use(cors({
  origin: "http://localhost:3000",
  methods: ["GET", "POST"],
  credentials: true
}));

Setting credentials: true means allowing cookies
